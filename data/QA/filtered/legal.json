Despite KPMG receiving $440,000 from ASIC to investigate the Sterling matter, they did not produce a report or communicate with tenants like Beryl and Ray effectively. This lack of communication and transparency left them without information or assistance. A property purchase was initially assured by KPMG, but it later fell through due to internal changes, leaving Beryl and Ray without resolution.

Efforts to reinvigorate community placement programs began in 2014, focusing on local detention centers as alternatives to larger facilities, which helped keep youth closer to home and improved access to reentry services. By 2016, the population in prison alternative programming had tripled. Additionally, the closing of Beaumont Juvenile Correction Center in 2017 was part of these initiatives. Virginia also invested more in community-based services, although a significant portion of resources still went towards out-of-home placements.",

    "complete_answer": "Funding plays a crucial role in supporting partnership activities, as many partnerships rely on 'mainstream' funding from individual budgets and staff time. Dedicated funding sources, such as from Police and Crime Commissioners or NGOs, usually cover only secretariat and meeting hosting costs. The lack of specific resources makes it difficult to address identified needs and deliver activities, risking partnerships becoming just regular meetings. A dedicated co-ordinator enhances partnership activities by allowing the implementation of action plans and strengthening relationships. More partnerships are securing funding for a dedicated co-ordinator, often through a Police and Crime Commissioner, with longer-term roles providing the necessary time for sustained anti-slavery resilience. Additionally, the ability to fund a co-ordinator for a sustained period is vital for maintaining anti-slavery efforts and building long-term resilience. Even part-time co-ordinators can significantly enhance activity and practice within partnerships, as seen in Southend.",

          "Where dedicated funding does exist, such as from Police and Crime Commissioners, NGOs, or the police, the majority of this is only for secretariat and meeting hosting costs, still leaving a significant funding gap that hinders service delivery and other activities, much of which continues to be done in good faith, because it is linked to existing statutory remits, or is believed to contribute to existing organisational objectives.",
          "Resourcing, as with almost all public and third sector activity, is a constant topic of discussion.",
