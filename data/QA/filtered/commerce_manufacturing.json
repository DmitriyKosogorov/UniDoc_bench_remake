Despite a quota, Canadian shipments exceeded limits due to favorable log supply and prices, but were expected to decline by 2.5% in 1998. The West's share decreased from 43% to 30.7%, while imports increased from 27% to 35.6%. Southern production also changed, experiencing reductions due to timber sales and weather issues.

    "complete_answer": "The availability of raw materials for meat production is influenced by the life stages of animals and the timing of demand forecasts. The image and context highlight that different meat types have specific time windows related to their life stages. For chickens, demand forecasts are typically shared earlier than their optimum timing, leading to increased supply chain noise. For pork, beef, and fish, forecasts are often shared too late, after the animals are born, causing potential scarcity and inaccurate production alignment with demand. Timely demand planning is crucial; for instance, fish size at capture impacts availability, and beef animals have stepwise categories that determine their use based on age. Thus, the stage of life directly affects how raw materials become available for production, underscoring the need for precise demand forecasting aligned with these timelines.",

This mark was likely used between ca. 1895 and ca. 1915. Challenges for glass producers included determining the correct manufacturer, as several companies like Binghamton Glass Co. (1880-1928), Brookfield Glass Co. (1868-1922), and Bellingham Glass Co. (1906-1910) were active during this period. The distance to potential manufacturers suggested that Binghamton or Brookfield were more likely choices than Bellingham for Moxie's New England market.",
