Instructors go from unexplored views, biases, and values to understanding their own. Pedagogy evolves from filling students with knowledge to being critical and equity-oriented. Classroom environments transition from ignored to inclusive and empowering. Student assessment methods change from standardized to those suited to student diversity, and student adjustment moves from adjusting to cover material to addressing diverse needs.

He combined these traditional Asian methods with modern Art Déco designs, applying lacquer to furniture, wall panels, paintings, metal vases, jewelry, and textiles. Dunand further demonstrated the fire resistance of lacquer using a blow torch on a gypsum-based table. He set up a lacquer studio in Paris and used urushi from Indochina, benefiting from Asian assistants experienced in lacquer work, which became central to his artistic output in the 1920s and 1930s.",

From 7th to 17th September 2014, they utilized CERN’s beam line and various detectors to track the pion decay process, identify incoming particles, and measure the energy of resulting particles. The students chose to work with a positive pion beam for its higher particle multiplicity and minimal positron interference. Their setup included Cherenkov counters, delay wire chambers, calorimeters, and a muon filter to measure and analyze the decay outcomes.",
