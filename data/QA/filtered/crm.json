Initially, daily activity profiles are clustered by application to create 'typical application days,' which summarize behaviors such as inactivity, mean or high activity during specific periods, and very high activity over long periods. These typical days form the basis for further analysis. They are used to form global daily activity profiles by replacing the initial traffic profile with vectors representing typical day segments. Further clustering yields 'typical day' profiles summarizing daily activity across applications. Customers are characterized by the proportion of days spent in each 'typical day' cluster over a month, leading to the identification of 'typical customers.'

    "complete_answer": "TPControl facilitates managing connection profiles with AMX NetLinx systems by ensuring WiFi is enabled and connected to the correct IP Network, configuring the HOST field with the correct IP address of the AMX NetLinx control system, and assigning unique Device IDs for avoiding conflicts. The 'Connect using profile' window allows selection and management of profiles, where each profile contains connection-specific information including network settings and unique identifiers. For multi-TP4 file versions, it allows defining specific TP4 File Slots for each profile. TPControl supports five user-definable profiles, which can be dynamically updated using the API to provide limitless configurations. Additionally, TPControl can assign and recall TP4 files to profiles, managing file slot assignments through an interface or the API.",
